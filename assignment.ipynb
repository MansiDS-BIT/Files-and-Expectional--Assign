    "Multithreading is preferable when:\n",

    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "A process pool is a collection of worker processes that can execute tasks concurrently. Instead of spawning a new process for every task (which is expensive), the pool reuses a fixed number of processes to handle multiple tasks. This improves performance and resource management.\n",
